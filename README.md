## Abstract
**(See the full paper [here]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01583](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10160655)))**

With autonomous aerial vehicles enacting safety-critical missions, such as the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover's landing on Mars, the tasks of automatically identifying and reasoning about potentially hazardous landing sites is paramount. This paper presents a coupled perception-planning solution which addresses the hazard detection, optimal landing trajectory generation, and contingency planning challenges encountered when landing in uncertain environments. Specifically, we develop and combine two novel algorithms, Hazard-Aware Landing Site Selection (HALSS) and Adaptive Deferred-Decision Trajectory Optimization (Adaptive-DDTO), to address the perception and planning challenges, respectively. The HALSS framework processes point cloud information to identify feasible safe landing zones, while Adaptive-DDTO is a multi-target contingency planner that adaptively replans as new perception information is received. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using a simulated Martian environment and show that our coupled perception-planning method achieves greater landing success whilst being more fuel efficient compared to a nonadaptive DDTO approach.

## Overview
This repository contains submodules to both the **Hazard-Aware Landing Site Selection (HALSS)** and **Adaptive Deferred-Decision Trajectory Optimization (Adaptive-DDTO)** repositories, as well as code to interface these submodules together in the **AirSim** environment. In each aforementioned submodule repository, you will find a ðŸ“œ`demo.ipynb` file that illustrates how each algorithm works. Results from the full paper cannot be precisely replicated at this time, as the full HALO environment assets cannot be made public, however instructions are provided below to enable simulation in a similar environment with a provided digital elevation map (DEM).

## Setup

### Software Requirements:
* Unreal Engine version 4.27.2 (see setup instructions [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/free-download/game-development-engine?utm_source=GoogleSearch&utm_medium=Performance&utm_campaign=20121040491&utm_id=150460841753&utm_term=video%20game%20engines&utm_content=669868333880))
* Microsoft AirSim platform (see setup instructions [here](https://microsoft.github.io/AirSim/))
* Julia -- latest version (see setup instructions [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/))
* Anaconda -- latest version (see setup instructions [here]([https://www.anaconda.com/](https://www.anaconda.com/download))

### Environment Configuration:
TBD (will use `Airsim/setup/halo_depthmap.png`)

### Other Steps:
The settings file provided at `AirSim/setup/settings.json` must be relocated on a Windows machine to the path `C:/Documents/AirSim/settings.json` as per AirSim setup instructions. 

Additionally, a new Anaconda ("conda") environment must be created using the `environment.yaml` file with the following commmand:
```
HALO$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Operation
HALSS and Adaptive-DDTO are currently configured to communicate through a manual publisher-subscriber architecture using [NumPy data files](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/how-to-io.html) temporarily stored in `AirSim/temp`. This will eventually be refactored for communication in [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) instead. The `AirSim/` folder contains two run files, `run_halss.py` and `run_addto.py`, along with utility scripts and functions in the `utils/` folder. Most hyperparameters can be set in either of these top-level run files (with some exceptions that must be set in `AdaptiveDDTO/src/params.jl`); please see the next section for more information. While HALSS is natively written in Python, Adaptive-DDTO is entirely written in the Julia language, with the `PyCall.jl` package used to facilitate communication with Adaptive-DDTO codebase.

To simulate a HALO scenario, open two separate terminals, `cd` to the top level of this repository, and begin with activating the configured Anaconda environment in both:
```
HALO$ conda activate halo
```

The actual AirSim simulation loop is initiated in `run_addto.py`, and so proceed to calling the following in one terminal:
```
HALO$ python AirSim/run_addto.py
```

This script will proceed with vehicle setup until the vehicle is positioned at the desired initial conditions (set in the corresponding run file). Once the vehicle is positioned correctly, the script will pause for user input with the line `[INPUT]: Press any key to begin landing maneuver`. At this point, switch to the other terminal, and proceed to call the HALSS process:
```
HALO$ python AirSim/run_halss.py
```

Once the HALSS process has began producing a (consistently-updated) plotting interface, switch back to the Adaptive-DDTO process terminal, and press any key to engage the simulation loop. We note that the first time Julia runs the Adaptive-DDTO code stack, it is also compiling, and so the first trajectory execution will take a considerably-longer amount of time than all proceeding executions. We also note that HALSS can also be instantiated as a Python subprocess by setting the flag `flag_HALSS_subprocess = True` in `run_addto.py`, allowing this whole simulation to be executed in one terminal, however doing this will prevent access to debugging print statements in the HALSS process.
